  <h1>Polynomials</h1>
<p>
  If your problem can be modeled with a low-order polynomial equation, then it won't stay a problem for long. Let's look at the forms of the four simplest orders:
</p>
  <dl>
      <dt>Constant</dt>
        <dd>Constant polynomials have the form a.</dd>
      <dt>Linear</dt>
        <dd>Linear polynomials have the form a &times; x &#43; b.</dd>
      <dt>Quadratic</dt>
        <dd>Quadratic polynomials have the form a &times; x &sup2; &#43; b  &times; x &#43; c .</dd>
      <dt>Cubic</dt>
        <dd>Cubic polynomials have the form a  &times; x&sup3; &#43; b  &times; x&sup2; &#43; c &times; x &#43; d .</dd>
