  <h1>Polynomials</h1>
<p>
  If your problem can be modeled with a low-order polynomial equation, then it won't stay a problem for long. Let's look at the forms of the four simplest orders:
</p>

<p>Constant</p>
  <blockquote>Constant polynomials have the form a.</blockquote>
<p>Linear</p>
  <blockquote>Linear polynomials have the form a &times; x &#43; b.</blockquote>
<p>Quadratic</p>
  <blockquote>Quadratic polynomials have the form a &times; x &sup2; &#43; b  &times; x &#43; c .</blockquote>
<p>Cubic</p>
  <blockquote>Cubic polynomials have the form a  &times; x&sup3; &#43; b  &times; x&sup2; &#43; c &times; x &#43; d .</blockquote>
